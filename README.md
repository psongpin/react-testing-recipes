## React-Testing-Library Recipes

This is a work in progress. This will serve as a recipe for conducting tests with react components using `react-testing-library` and `jest`.

### Project Structure
- `components` - contains the components to be tested
- `__tests__` - contains the tests in numeric order based on the filenames.
